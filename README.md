### 3) [Programming] Follow the instructions in order to get the TJBot working. 
Once you are done, you are now working on the final and most crucial (possibly the most difficult) step. We will run the NodeJS programming on “Geany Programmer’s Editor”. 


1. Go to Menu > Programming > Geany Programmer’s Editor 
![alt text][geany] 

You will see this on your screen. 
![alt text][geany2] 


2. On Terminal, change the directory to ```tjbot``` by typing the following. 
![alt text][cdtjbot] 
Press "enter" when done. 


3. On Terminal, run the following. 
```
git init
git fetch --all
git reset --hard origin
```
If this give you error such as 
```fatal: ambiguous argument 'origin': unknown revision or path not in the work tree```
do this then: 
```
git pull
```

![alt text][gitinit] 


4. When done,  change the directory again to ```recipes``` then ```speech_to_text``` by typing the following
```
cd recipes/speech_to_text/ 
```
![alt text][s2t] 


5. On Geany's Code Editor, open the file "config.js" to change the password and username according the paper given. Save the file after that. 
![alt text][configcred1] 
![alt text][configcred2] 
![alt text][configcred3] 


6. Test "LEDtest.js" to see if your tricolor LED is working. 
```bash
sudo node LEDtest.js 
```

7. Test "MICtest.js" to see if your microphone is sending signals to IBM Watson.
```bash
sudo node MICtest.js 
```
Try to speak into the microphone, see what is printed on the Terminal. 
![alt text][mictest] 

To exit from the running program, ```CTRL + C```. 


8. Test "SERVOtest.js" to see if your servo motor is working fine.
```bash
sudo node SERVOtest.js 
```

9. If all set, we will run "stt.js" to see the full effect. 
```bash
sudo node stt.js
```
To exit from the running program, ```CTRL + C```.

## Setting up the environment
1) Read the original instructable [here](http://www.instructables.com/id/Use-Your-Voice-to-Control-a-Light-With-Watson/)

2) Prepare the correct environment 

```bash 
sudo apt-get -y update
sudo apt-get -y dist-upgrade
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_6.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
sudo apt-get install -y alsa-base alsa-utils libasound2-dev
```

3) Get the tjbot repository from [Github](https://github.com/zhix/tjbot) 
```git 
git clone https://github.com/zhix/tjbot.git
cd tjbot/recipes/speech_to_text/
sudo npm install  
```

###### (if **_sudo npm install_** produces error such as **_WARN EACCES user "root" does not have permission to access the dev dir ..._**, go to home directory (**_cd /home/pi/_**) and delete the folder **_.npm/_** by **_rm -rf .npm/_** .) 

4) Install rpio package

```bash
sudo npm install rpio 
sudo npm install readline-sync
```

5) Test the microphone

To check the existence of the device:

```bash
lsusb
```

After checking the device is available, make sure you reboot Raspberry Pi to make the device available on alsamixer. 
Next on choose the recording device (USB PnP) on alsamixer, change the "gain". 

```bash 
alsamixer
arecord -l
```

Finally, try recording: ```arecord a.wav -D sysdefault:CARD=1```

When done, "CTRL+C" to exit. Replay the recording with omxplayer by ```omxplayer a.wav```. You need to adjust the noise settings of the microphone through ```alsamixer```. 

6) Edit the config.js file as noted in the Instructables [Step 5](http://www.instructables.com/id/Use-Your-Voice-to-Control-a-Light-With-Watson/).

7) Test "LEDtest.js" to see if your tricolor LED is working. 

```bash
sudo node LEDtest.js 
```

8) Test "MICtest.js" to see if your microphone is sending signals to IBM Watson.

```bash
sudo node MICtest.js 
```

To exit from the running program, ```CTRL + C```. 

9) Test "SERVOtest.js" to see if your servo motor is working fine.


```bash
sudo node SERVOtest.js 
```

10) When ready, run "stt.js" with ```sudo node stt.js``` and get the fun begin. 

To exit from the running program, ```CTRL + C```.

# Contribute to TJBot
TJBot is open source and we'd love to see what you can make with him. Here are some ideas to get you started.

    - Visual recognition. TJBot has a placeholder behind his left eye to insert a Raspberry Pi camera. Try connecting the camera to the Watson Visual Recognition API so TJ can say hello when he sees you.

    - IoT. The Watson IoT service lets you control smart home devices (e.g. Philips Hue, LIFX lights, etc. ). Connect TJBot to IoT and have him control your home.

    - Connected robots. You can program multiple TJBots to send messages to each other using the Watson IoT platform.

If you have created your own recipe, we would love to include it as a [featured recipe](featured/README.md)! Just submit a pull request for your receipe instructions and code and send a link to a demo video to tjbot@us.ibm.com (Vimeo & YouTube preferred). We will review it and if we decide to include it in our repository, you'll be listed as the developer. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

We cannot wait to see what you build with [TJBot](http://ibm.biz/mytjbot)!

# About TJBot
[TJ](http://ibm.biz/mytjbot) is affectionately named after Thomas J. Watson, the first Chairman and CEO of IBM. TJBot was born at IBM Research as an experiment to find the best practices in the design and implementation of cognitive objects.
